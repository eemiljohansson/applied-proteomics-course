## Description of the lab

This is the main file for LAB 4 for the course of Applied Proteomics (CB2110).

## Loading libraries

```{r}
# Libraries we need to execute the code in this lab
libs <- c(
  "tidyverse", "readxl", "corrplot", "pheatmap", "VIM",
  "heatmaply", "plotly", "ggvenn", "ggrepel", "RColorBrewer"
)

# Install missing libraries
installed_libs <- libs %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_libs == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(libs[!installed_libs])
}

# Load libraries
invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.only = TRUE))
```


## Load data

For this course we will use the data from the unpublished paper "Plasma proteome profiling of patients with acute coronary syndrome" by Johansson E et al (2024).

```{r}
# Load data
#TODO: Save your data in a variable called "data" and load it here

# Example: data <- read_excel("your/path/to/data/here.xlsx")
```
